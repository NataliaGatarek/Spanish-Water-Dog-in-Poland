        The unique look of these inexhaustible workers begins with the coat.
        <br />It’s naturally curly and wooly head to toe, and when grown out<br />
        will often form tight, tapered cords.
        <br />
        In full coat, the facial hair covers the expressive brown eyes.<br />
        Colors can be black, brown, beige, white, or particolor (black, brown,
        beige, with white). <br />“Rustic” is the word often used to describe
        <br />the overall look of this sturdy dog of medium size.

        Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions<br />
        such as hip dysplasia and eye anomalies. <br />As with all breeds, the
        Spanish Water Dog’s ears should be cleaned <br />and checked regularly
        for signs of infection.<br />
        The teeth should be brushed often, ideally every day, using a toothpaste
        formulated for dogs. <br />Recommended Health Test from the National
